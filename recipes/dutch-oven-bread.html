        <h2>Bread fit for a Viking?</h2>
        <p>This recipe is so easy to make, its prep takes just minutes. Praise the Gods! The secret for this variation of bread 
           is in the pan, requiring <a href"https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=dutch%20oven%20pots">the Dutch type</a>. Looks like we're headed east again for this summer's raids..

            In addition to a covered cook in this pan, this dough in particular will be a no-knead loaf, leaving more time for that last cup of mead.
            It starts like most most bread recipes, combining flour, yeast, and some salt. Mixed together with warm water (~105 degrees), and you're set
            to let it proof for a few hours. One KEY thing for this recipe: cook the dutch pot for 30 mins so it becomes hot. Then when you are ready to put the 
            dough in everything is already cooking and going, generating that steam to rise and hit the pot lid and come back down, -giving you a crispy outer loaf!
